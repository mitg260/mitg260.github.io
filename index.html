        <h2>About US</h2>
        <p>As Educaid of New Mexico, we urge everyone to support quality education for everyone. We ask for donations from everybody willing. This money will help provide resources for APS (Albuquerque Public Schools) so that they can deliver education at the same standards of a private school. In this way, children will not have to pay an unnecessary premium for good education. If we were a real non-profit, we would be a 501(c)(3) organization.</p>

            <td width="75%"><h2>About the Issue</h2><p>Education is very important because it empowers people to do well in life, help the environment, and do other good things in life. According to a 2013 report by The College Board, the median yearly income of someone who hasn't attended school is $35,400. The median yearly income of someone who has attended college and earned a bachelor's degree is $56,500. This report also found that 8% of people with bachelor's degrees smoked, and 25% of people with only a high school diploma smoked. This study shows that well educated people tend to make healthier choices and achieve more. This nonprofit will let people go to school so that they can learn, and hopefully, from learning, they could be aspired to go to college and learn more!</p></td>

        <td><h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>This nonprofit organization was originally created by the Federalist Papers Company in 1788 led by James Madison. Its original name was the Federalist Education Sustaining System. Half of the donations given to write the Federalist Papers went to the Federalist Education Sustaining System so that the system could give money to children's families. Then, the families could pay the teachers which taught the children. Eventually, the Federalist Papers were abolished, but the Federalist Education Sustaining System was kept alive. Since the areas around where the system was already very well educated, the new leader of the program, Charles Kent, moved to Tennessee. He died there, but his son moved to the New Mexico territory in 1851. There he rebuilt the program and named it Education Assistance of New Mexico. The Education Assistance of New Mexico organization helped create the Albuquerque Public School system in 1891. The death of Kent in 1901 resulted in a new leader for the organization. This leader was named Elena Hunworth, who was only 23 years of age at the time of her inauguration. In 1981, when she was 78, Elena renamed the organization to its current name, EducAid of New Mexico, to model the name after the new proposed Medicaid Program.</p></td>
